            <p>
                Click "Get Show" to get started and the application will load a random TV show title from the TVMaze
                API.
            </p>
            <p>
                From there you will have the option to guess how many seasons and episode the show contains. There are a
                total of 5 guesses and 3 rounds. After the first guess the hint section will update and tell you if you
                need to guess higher (+) or lower (-). The border on the input sections will also be changed based on if
                the guess is correct (green), wrong (red), or within 1 (yellow).
            </p>
            <p>
                The reset button can be used at any time to bring the game state back to the beginning.
            </p>
            <h3>Help</h3>
            <p>
                As it is quite hard to guess how many episodes a TV show has you can click the boxes, after one
                guess
                to have the answers shown.
            </p>
            <p>
                WARNING: on subsequent rounds this will only update after the first guess has
                been made.
